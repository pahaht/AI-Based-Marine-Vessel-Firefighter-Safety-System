# AI-Based-Marine-Vessel-Firefighter-Safety-System

### *Introduction*
In order to identify the firefighter who might be in a dangerous situation in the next moment,
we will use Internet of Things (IoT) technology to connect all protective devices used by firefighters. 
It should be noted that these protective devices are wearable. All the data recorded by each
sensor-equipped fire protection device will be sent in real-time to the fireboat located near 
the burning ship using Bluetooth Beacon.
